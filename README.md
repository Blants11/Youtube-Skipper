# Youtube-Skipper
Firefox extension to automatically skip Youtube videos by a specified amount

## To Do

- Write function to store input time value and enable flag into local storage
- skipContent.js is executed whenever a youtube page loads, if enable flag is found then add the timestamp to the url and reload
- skipContent.js needs to check if current url already contains a timestamp, if so don't change anything

## Other
